## 1 Scope

This European Standard specifies checks, test methods and measuring instruments in order to verify the fitness for purpose of the installed systems primarily for handing over which will be partially performed before, during and after handing over.

This European Standard enables the choice between simple test methods, when sufficient, and extensive measurements, when necessary.

This European Standard applies to mechanically operated ventilation and air conditioning systems as specified in EN 12792 and comprising any of the following:

- air terminal devices and units,
- air handling units,
- air distribution systems (supply, extract, exhaust),
- fire protection devices,
- automatic control devices.

When the system is set, adjusted and balanced measurement methods described in this European Standard apply.

This European Standard does not apply to:

- heat generating systems and their control,
- refrigerating systems and their control,
- distribution of heating and cooling medium to the air handling units,
- compressed air supplying systems,
- water conditioning systems,
- central steam generating systems for air humidifying,
- electric supply systems.

This European Standard applies to ventilation and air conditioning systems designed for the maintenance of comfort conditions in buildings. It is not applicable in the case of systems for the control of industrial or other special process environments. In the latter case, however, it may be referred to if the system technology is similar to that of the above mentioned ventilation and air conditioning systems.

This European Standard does not include any requirements concerning the installation contract. However, in order to facilitate the application of this standard, the installation contract should refer to the provisions which are listed in Annex F.

The measuring methods in this European Standard can be used in the frame of the energy inspection of air-conditioning systems according to EU Directive 2010/31/EU \"Energy performance of buildings Directive\" (see EN 15239, EN 15240).

This European Standard may be used for residential and dwelling ventilation systems.

## 3 Test and check procedure

The following steps shall be carried out in the given order:

a) completeness checks;  
b) functional checks;  
c) functional measurements;  
d) special measurements;

## 5 Functional checks

### 5.1 General

The purpose of the functional check is to prove the operation of installation in different operational conditions in compliance with the relevant technical rules and the specification. The check shows whether the particular elements of the system such as filters, fans, heat exchangers, coolers, humidifiers etc. have been properly installed.

### 5.2 Put system into use

Put the system in running, adjusted and safe condition.

Adjustment protocols and operation instructions shall be available.

### 5.3 Procedure

Functional checks shall be carried out on every kind of installed equipment.

Before starting the checks, a checklist shall be drawn up.

The extent of functional checks is defined in Annex C.

The locations for the checks shall be the subject of prior agreement by the parties concerned.

Instruction for the procedure and a list of usual functional checks are given in Annex B.
### Explanations
- 0 measurement not necessary  
- 1 to carry out in all cases  
- 2 to carry out only in the case of contracted agreement  

Figures 0-2 indicate whether there has to be a test within the stage of functional measurements during the handing over. Some of the tests are already done by the installer prior to the handing over and the documentation shall be verified in the completeness check.

- C: cool  
- D: dehumidify  
- F: filter  
- H: heat  
- M: humidify (moisture)  
- Z: without any thermodynamic air handling functions (zero)

### 6.3 Procedure

Before starting the functional measurement, the measuring locations shall be specified and the procedures and measuring devices shall be agreed upon and given in the technical documents.

The number of measuring points in a room should take into account the floor area and the measured parameters. At least one measuring position is required for measurements in rooms of area up to 20 m²; larger rooms should be subdivided accordingly. For the measurements in the room, the measuring positions in the occupied zone shall be agreed between the parties concerned, preferably at positions intended for intensive occupancy.

With regard to the selection of the measuring instruments the overall uncertainty shall be taken into account. Calibrated devices shall be used.

The indoor climate factors and air flow rates, heating, cooling and humidifying performances, electrical characteristics and other design data shall be measured at the ventilation system design air flow rate. The permissible uncertainties of the measured values are given in Table 3.

#### Table 3 — Permissible uncertainty of the measurement

| Parameter | Uncertainty* |
|------------|-------------|
| Air flow rate, each individual room | ± 15 % |
| Air flow rate, each system | ± 10 % |
| Supply air temperature | ± 2 °C |
| Relative humidity [RH] | ± 15 % RH |
| Air velocity in occupied zone | ± 0.05 m/s |
| Air temperature in occupied zone | ± 1.5 °C |
| A-weighted sound pressure level in the room | ± 3 dBA |

> *) This European Standard does not define tolerances for the design values itself. The result is accepted when the design value is in the range of the uncertainty of the measurement.
