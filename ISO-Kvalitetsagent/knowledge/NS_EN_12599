## 1 Scope

This European Standard specifies checks, test methods and measuring instruments in order to verify the fitness for purpose of the installed systems primarily for handing over which will be partially performed before, during and after handing over.

This European Standard enables the choice between simple test methods, when sufficient, and extensive measurements, when necessary.

This European Standard applies to mechanically operated ventilation and air conditioning systems as specified in EN 12792 and comprising any of the following:

- air terminal devices and units,
- air handling units,
- air distribution systems (supply, extract, exhaust),
- fire protection devices,
- automatic control devices.

When the system is set, adjusted and balanced measurement methods described in this European Standard apply.

This European Standard does not apply to:

- heat generating systems and their control,
- refrigerating systems and their control,
- distribution of heating and cooling medium to the air handling units,
- compressed air supplying systems,
- water conditioning systems,
- central steam generating systems for air humidifying,
- electric supply systems.

This European Standard applies to ventilation and air conditioning systems designed for the maintenance of comfort conditions in buildings. It is not applicable in the case of systems for the control of industrial or other special process environments. In the latter case, however, it may be referred to if the system technology is similar to that of the above mentioned ventilation and air conditioning systems.

This European Standard does not include any requirements concerning the installation contract. However, in order to facilitate the application of this standard, the installation contract should refer to the provisions which are listed in Annex F.

The measuring methods in this European Standard can be used in the frame of the energy inspection of air-conditioning systems according to EU Directive 2010/31/EU \"Energy performance of buildings Directive\" (see EN 15239, EN 15240).

This European Standard may be used for residential and dwelling ventilation systems.

## 5 Functional checks

### 5.1 General

The purpose of the functional check is to prove the operation of installation in different operational conditions in compliance with the relevant technical rules and the specification. The check shows whether the particular elements of the system such as filters, fans, heat exchangers, coolers, humidifiers etc. have been properly installed.

### 5.2 Put system into use

Put the system in running, adjusted and safe condition.

Adjustment protocols and operation instructions shall be available.

### 5.3 Procedure

Functional checks shall be carried out on every kind of installed equipment.

Before starting the checks, a checklist shall be drawn up.

The extent of functional checks is defined in Annex C.

The locations for the checks shall be the subject of prior agreement by the parties concerned.

Instruction for the procedure and a list of usual functional checks are given in Annex B.
### Explanations
- 0 measurement not necessary  
- 1 to carry out in all cases  
- 2 to carry out only in the case of contracted agreement  

Figures 0-2 indicate whether there has to be a test within the stage of functional measurements during the handing over. Some of the tests are already done by the installer prior to the handing over and the documentation shall be verified in the completeness check.

- C: cool  
- D: dehumidify  
- F: filter  
- H: heat  
- M: humidify (moisture)  
- Z: without any thermodynamic air handling functions (zero)

---

### 6.3 Procedure

Before starting the functional measurement, the measuring locations shall be specified and the procedures and measuring devices shall be agreed upon and given in the technical documents.

The number of measuring points in a room should take into account the floor area and the measured parameters. At least one measuring position is required for measurements in rooms of area up to 20 m²; larger rooms should be subdivided accordingly. For the measurements in the room, the measuring positions in the occupied zone shall be agreed between the parties concerned, preferably at positions intended for intensive occupancy.

With regard to the selection of the measuring instruments the overall uncertainty shall be taken into account. Calibrated devices shall be used.

The indoor climate factors and air flow rates, heating, cooling and humidifying performances, electrical characteristics and other design data shall be measured at the ventilation system design air flow rate. The permissible uncertainties of the measured values are given in Table 3.

#### Table 3 — Permissible uncertainty of the measurement

| Parameter | Uncertainty* |
|------------|-------------|
| Air flow rate, each individual room | ± 15 % |
| Air flow rate, each system | ± 10 % |
| Supply air temperature | ± 2 °C |
| Relative humidity [RH] | ± 15 % RH |
| Air velocity in occupied zone | ± 0.05 m/s |
| Air temperature in occupied zone | ± 1.5 °C |
| A-weighted sound pressure level in the room | ± 3 dBA |

> *) This European Standard does not define tolerances for the design values itself. The result is accepted when the design value is in the range of the uncertainty of the measurement.

## 6.4 Measuring methods and measuring devices

### 6.4.1 General
Annex D provides information concerning measuring methods and devices which are adequate for the functional measurement.

In the case of measurements in ducts and air conditioning systems with negative pressure, measuring errors due to an infiltration by the measuring device opening of air shall be avoided.

In any case, the openings in the ducts have to be closed after measuring.

---

### 6.4.2 Measurement of the air flow rate
The air flow rate can be evaluated by different methods. Usually, it is calculated from the air velocity and the corresponding cross-section. The air velocity can be measured by means of an appropriate anemometer, Pitot Static Tube (Prandtl tube) or a pressure drop across a throttling device.

Air flow rates should be measured at an appropriate cross-section of a duct. As air velocity is seldom uniform, it should be measured at an appropriate number of locations in the cross-section and averaged for the mean velocity.

The total air flow rate of a system should preferably be measured within the air handling unit or fan casing with integrated measurement if equipment like inlet nozzles is available.

For air terminal devices, other methods (e.g. bag method, reference pressure methods or funnel measurement) can be applied. The air terminal devices with a low pressure drop should be measured by means of the compensation method or other methods with a non-significant pressure drop.

The different measuring methods and devices are described in D.1.

---

### 6.4.3 Measurement of the ductwork leakage
The leakage of the ductwork is important for the energy efficiency of the complete air conditioning system. The tightness class according to EN 1507 and EN 12237 shall be checked.

In large and complex air duct systems, the leakage can only be measured in a part of the system. The leakage measurement shall be performed while the duct is being installed and accessible.

After start of operation a second tightness test can be necessary, only if an irregularity happens during the start up. (In the case of a malfunction e.g. of fire dampers, the pressure can exceed the allowed pressure and damage the ductwork.)

The measuring methods and devices are described in D.8.

---

### 6.4.4 Measurement of the indoor air velocity
Indoor air flow is usually a turbulent flow. The air velocity varies from place to place within the room, the variations being random with regard to magnitude and direction. Therefore, an exact measurement of the air velocity is complicated. Generally, it is sufficient to measure the mean air velocity at selected positions (see D.2.1).

In rooms up to approximately 20 m² floor area, one measurement position is sufficient. Large rooms (e.g. landscaped offices) should be measured on the similar basis to the foregoing and positions in the occupied zone should be chosen where higher air velocities can be expected. Measurements should preferably be taken at positions intended for intensive occupancy, e.g. at the desk in an office.
### 6.4.5 Measurement of air temperature
Air temperature measurements may be required in the room, at the exhaust air terminal device or in the duct.

When – due to high or low surface temperatures (windows, cooling/heating panels etc.) – thermal discomfort is suspected, it may be necessary to evaluate the operative temperature (see D.3.1).

The measurement of the air temperature is described in D.3.

---

### 6.4.6 Measurement of the air humidity
The measurements of the air humidity in the room provide information regarding the humidifying or dehumidifying operation of the system. In general, the relative humidity is measured. To calculate the absolute humidity it is also necessary to measure the air temperature at the same location.

The use of recording instruments is necessary. The recording period shall last for 24 h at least.

The measurement of the air humidity is described in D.4.

---

### 6.4.7 Measurement of the sound pressure level
The A-weighted sound pressure level shall be determined at places of work. Corresponding conditions within the room are given in CR 1752.

Outside the building, measurements of sound pressure level can be necessary at locations such as property boundaries or 0.5 m in front of a neighboring open window taking account of any special conditions.

In all cases the background sound pressure level shall additionally be recorded when the system is not in operation. The measurement of the sound pressure level is described in D.5.

---

### 6.4.8 Measurement of the electrical power of the fan
The electrical power (including auxiliary) consumed is measured either directly by a power meter (watt-meter) or indirectly from the electrical work (kWh-meter) performed by taking the electric meter readings before and after the test for a measured period of time.

For three-phase motors the power is determined by the 2-watt-meter method. For single phase motors, the power is determined by the 1-watt-meter method.

Specific requirements shall be considered when a frequency converter is being used.

The measurement of the electrical power of the fan is described in D.6.

---

### 6.4.9 Measurement of the pressure difference at the air filter
Check that the filter is properly installed and is seated with no visible leaks.

The measurement of the pressure difference across the air filter is described in D.7.

---

## 6.5 Accompanying measurements
The following data can be determined and registered if required in order to record the operating conditions during the functional test:

- outdoor temperature and humidity,
- hot and cold water temperature at the distributor or at the air heater and air cooler,
## 7 Special measurements (see Annex E)

### 7.1 General
The measurements together with the appropriate measuring instruments can necessitate a considerable amount of work and associated costs. These require special contractual agreements which cover the nature and scope of performance.

Special measurements are appropriate where functional measurements are not sufficient to verify the quality of the system in the desired range of accuracy.

The programme of measurements, the parameters to be measured, the measuring instruments and the measuring points shall be agreed separately. The agreement should also cover the permitted uncertainty of the measured results. The agreement should be made before the particular system is installed. The work and cost involved in the measurements shall be commensurate with the requirements of the system. If the measuring uncertainty cannot be achieved for an acceptable cost, the client shall be informed with adequate notice before the measuring has commenced. The measurements should be performed only by persons possessing the necessary knowledge and experience.

The measurements can be restricted to equipment or components in the system.

It may be necessary to test the system during summer and winter operation.

The operating mode during the measurements should, where possible, reflect the agreed conditions. If this is not the case, it shall be possible to deduce the design data. For certain components (e.g. heat exchanger, cooler), it is necessary to convert the measuring results to the design data.

If operational or technical aspects do not permit a component or element to be measured when it is installed, then the item may be tested on a test bed.

When judging the results of measuring in an air conditioned space the influence of physical characteristics of the building should be taken into account.

For approval measuring instruments see E.1.

### 7.3 Measurements of components

#### 7.3.1 Fans

##### 7.3.1.1 Measuring
For testing a fan which forms part of an air-conditioning system the following data shall be determined:

- air flow according to E.2.4,
- total pressure difference according to E.2.1,
- pressure and temperature in the measurement cross-section according to E.2.1 and E.2.2,
- electric power according to E.2.7 and

### 7.2 Parameters
The measurement of the parameters is described in E.2.

---

### 7.3 Measurements of components

#### 7.3.1 Fans

##### 7.3.1.1 Measuring
For testing a fan which forms part of an air-conditioning system the following data shall be determined:

- air flow according to E.2.4,
- total pressure difference according to E.2.1,
- pressure and temperature in the measurement cross-section according to E.2.1 and E.2.2,
- electric power according to E.2.7 and
- speed of rotation (rpm).

The speed of rotation is usually measured with a tachometer, a stroboscope, or a pulse counter.

---

#### 7.3.1.2 Measurement uncertainty
The air flow and total pressure difference shall be converted by calculation to density ρ = 1.2 kg/m³. The assessment should take account of the installed situation and the inflow conditions.

The uncertainty shall be calculated in accordance with Clause 8.

---

### 7.3.2 Filters

#### 7.3.2.1 Measuring
For testing an installed filter the following data shall be measured:

- air flow according to E.2.4,
- velocity distribution at the filter using the network measurement in D.1.2 (determination of the velocity profile for air flow measurements), and
- pressure drop according E.2.1.

Check that the filter is properly installed and is seated with no visible leaks.

For high efficiency particulate air filters of classes H and U, in accordance with EN 1822-1, evidence shall be provided that no leaks are present in the filter material, the joint between the filter and the frame and the frame itself.

Depending on the installed situation of the filter two methods can be used to test such filters:

- the oil thread test,
- the particle count method.

---

#### 7.3.2.2 Measurement uncertainty
The uncertainty of the measurements of the air flow, air velocities and the pressure drop shall be calculated in accordance with Clause 8.

---

### 7.3.3 Heat exchangers

#### 7.3.3.1 General
It is assumed that the characteristic curves of the heat exchanger (operation characteristic data) are available from which the heating or cooling of the air as a temperature difference or as a relative parameter (related to the maximum temperature difference) as a function of the other mass flow (e.g. water) - and the pressure drop on the air side as a function of air flow - can be seen.

For air coolers, designed such that water condenses, the characteristic curves, under consideration of the humidity precipitation on the entire cooling surface, are - also for wet operation - decisive. In this case, enthalpies shall be used instead of temperatures.

A heat recovery system is a type of heat exchanger, so the same rules as for heat exchangers apply analogously.

Regenerative heat recovery systems which also transmit air humidity (category III according to EN 308) are characterised not only by the heating but also by the humidification
#### 7.3.3.2 Measuring
The following parameters shall be measured:

- air flow and air temperature at inlet and outlet of the heat exchanger,
- maximum deviation of air temperature from a mean value at inlet and outlet of the heat exchanger and
- pressure drop of the air flow and the flow of heating medium or coolant.

Additionally, the following should be measured:

- in the case of air heaters, the flow rate of the heating medium and its cooling, and the air humidity at the air terminal device,
- in the case of air coolers, the flow rate of the coolant and its heat gain, and also the reduction of humidity,
- in the case of heat recovery systems with humidity transmission (category III according to EN 308), the increase of humidity (return humidity index),
- in the case of regenerative heat recovery systems (categories II and III according to EN 308), the flow rate of the heat medium (e.g. also indirectly through the rotor rpm) and the power taken by the drive motor (e.g. for driving the rotor or a circulation pump).

If the characteristic curves are available, it is sufficient to measure at a single operating point.

If no characteristic curves are available and if the measured air flow rate differs greatly (> 30%) from the design rated value, then the heating index (return heating index) or the cooling index should be measured with at least three different air flow rates and converted by calculation to the design operating point. During this time, the other mass flow rate shall be held within the design region (± 20%).

Measurements on air heaters before and after the humidifier are basically performed together with the humidifier (see 7.3.4). It is not necessary to make separate measurements on the individual heat exchangers and on the concurrently operated humidifier. This assumes that with uniform temperatures at the air inlet to the air heater the temperatures at the air outlet from the air heater do not vary over the cross-section by more than 10% from a mean value. In this case it is sufficient to measure the flow rate of the heating medium and its cooling at one of the heat exchangers. The heating power of the individual air heaters is calculated from the total heating power and the enthalpy differences taken from the \"h, x - diagram\", (see Figure 1).
