# EN 14175-4 Test Procedures

## 5.4 Face velocity test

### 5.4.1 Objectives
The aim of the face velocity test as part of the commissioning testing is to verify the face velocity pattern compared to the type test result in order to check either correct installation of the fume cupboard or adverse effects of the room air conditions. Another aim should be to obtain a reference value for comparison in subsequent routine tests.

### 5.4.2 Test equipment and probe positions
According to EN 14175-3:2003, 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.

### 5.4.3 Test procedure and test results
The fume cupboard shall work with the intended working conditions. No other equipment than the test equipment shall be present inside the fume cupboard. The measurements and the calculation of the test results shall be performed at the type test opening(s) and at the actual air volume flow rate in accordance with EN 14175-3:2003, 5.2.3 and 5.2.4.

If the air volume flow rate is other than that established in the type test, it shall be noted.

> **NOTE:** Such a deviation can affect the face velocity pattern.

### 5.4.4 Test report
The calculated test results and the deviation of these test results from those specified in the type test certificate shall be reported (see 9.1).

## 5.5 Extract volume flow rate test

### 5.5.1 Objectives
The aim of the extract volume flow rate test as part of the commissioning testing is to verify the extract air volume flow compared to the intended volume flow and the correct installation of the fume cupboard. Additional purpose of the test is to obtain reference values for easy and fast routine testing (see Clause 6).

The extract volume flow discharged from a fume cupboard can generally be measured according to ISO 5221. When the requirements for the use of this method are not fulfilled, one of the following methods can be applied.

### 5.5.2 Average face velocity method

#### 5.5.2.1 Principle, test equipment and probe positions
This method determines the extract volume flow by measuring the face volume flow in the sash opening by making sure that all the extract air is flowing through the sash opening. Test equipment and probe positions in accordance with EN 14175-3:2003, 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.

#### 5.5.2.2 Preparation
Any significant leakage, slit or opening of the fume cupboard, except of the test sash opening, shall be sealed by adhesive tape or appropriate air tight material. The sealing material shall be removed after the face velocity measurement.

#### 5.5.2.4 Expression of results
Multiply the average face velocity at the sash opening with the area of the sash opening and report the resulting volume flow rate in m³/h together with the average face velocity, the sash area and the chosen sash opening.

If the face velocity test according to 5.4 has been performed, a correlation factor for the face velocity of the sealed and non-sealed fume cupboard can be calculated and documented in the commissioning test report as reference value for subsequent routine testing (see 6.3).

### 5.5.3 Calibrated pressure difference method

#### 5.5.3.1 Principle and test equipment
This method depends on the availability of manufacturer specified reference points. The method determines the extract volume flow by measuring the pressure difference between two reference points specified by the fume cupboard's manufacturer. Test equipment in accordance with EN 14175-3:2003, 5.6.2.

#### 5.5.3.2 Positioning of pressure tap(s) and test procedure
The test shall be carried out with the fume cupboard's sash(es) set at one of the type test sash opening(s) (see EN 14175-3:2003, 4.4.2). The pressure tap(s) shall be fitted to the reference point(s) specified and marked by the fume cupboard's manufacturer. Test procedure according to EN 14175-3:2003, 5.6.5.

#### 5.5.3.3 Expression of results
Take the extract volume flow corresponding to the measured pressure difference from the table or diagram supplied in the manufacturer's documentation. Report the measured pressure difference and the evaluated extract volume flow in m³/h together with the manufacturer's documentation identification and the reference measuring point(s).

## 5.6 Pressure drop test

### 5.6.1 Objectives
The aims of the pressure drop test as part of the commissioning testing are to obtain reference values for subsequent routine testing (see 6.4) and to verify the pressure drop at the current installation of the fume cupboard, compared to the intended pressure drop.

### 5.6.2 Test equipment and test procedure
According to EN 14175-3:2003, 5.6.2 to 5.6.5. If the fume cupboard's installation allows, the pressure taps shall be positioned as specified in EN 14175-3:2003, 5.6.4.

### 5.6.3 Expression of results
According to EN 14175-3:2003, 5.6.6. The pressure drop measured shall be documented in the commissioning test report (see 9.1) together with the corresponding extract volume flow rate. Differences from the type test and possible causes shall be reported.

## 5.7 Air flow visualization

### 5.7.1 Objectives
The aim of the air flow visualisation as part of the commissioning testing is to obtain qualitative information regarding room air flow and the interaction of the fume cupboard's air flow with the room air flow. Based on the test result, it should be decided whether subsequent tests, such as room air velocity test (see 5.8), are necessary.

### 5.7.2 Test procedure
Air flows around the installed fume cupboard and in the sash opening area should be visualized to check if there are any disturbances, e.g. by the room make-up air, that could affect the performance of the fume cupboard. Visualization shall be performed with generation of visible tracers, such as smoke, about 400 mm in front of the fume cupboard with release upwards to the ceiling. The density of the tracer shall be close to the room air density. The tracer shall be distributed with low impulse and not faster than 0.2 m/s.

### 5.7.3 Expression of results
Air movements around the working aperture shall be visualized and any kind of disturbance shall be documented in the commissioning test report (see 9.1).
